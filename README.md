# Artificial-Intelligence-Technology-in-Image-Generation-and-Manipulation

Deepfake technology, leveraging advancements in deep learning, has significantly impacted digital media by creating highly realistic but fabricated images, videos, and audio. This paper explores the current state of deepfake applications, emphasizing the underlying generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and autoencoders, that drive these innovations. Alongside, we delve into the forensic techniques developed to detect and counteract deepfake content, highlighting the ongoing catand-mouse game between generation and detection methods. Our review encompasses the technological, ethical, and social implications of deepfakes, presenting a comprehensive understanding of both the capabilities and the threats posed by this rapidly evolving field.
