# Artificial-Intelligence-Technology-in-Image-Generation-and-Manipulation

 Deepfake technology, leveraging advancements in deep learning, has signif
icantly impacted digital media by creating highly realistic but fabricated
 images, videos, and audio. This paper explores the current state of deepfake
 applications, emphasizing the underlying generative models, such as Gen
erative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and autoencoders, that drive these
 innovations. Alongside, we delve into the forensic techniques developed
 to detect and counteract deepfake content, highlighting the ongoing cat
and-mouse game between generation and detection methods. Our review
 encompasses the technological, ethical, and social implications of deepfakes,
 presenting a comprehensive understanding of both the capabilities and the
 threats posed by this rapidly evolving field.
